I'm a computer vision researcher and engineer.

During my PhD at [MPI](https://duckduckgo.com) focused on object perception skills for robots.

Later I joined [Wirewax](https://wirewax.com) in London where I had the pleasure to work on many fun computer vision problems like Face Indentification, 

I'm also a running enthusiast (=addict). When I'm not injured (which unfortunately has been rare lately) you usally find me somewhere on a trail or on a track. 
If possible together with people from these fabulous running clubs: 
[Seoul Flyers](https://duckduckgo.com), [Victoria Park Harriers](https://duckduckgo.com), [LAV Tübingen](https://duckduckgo.com)
