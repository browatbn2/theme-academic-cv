[//]: # (I'm a computer vision researcher and engineer. )

During my PhD at the [MPI in Tübingen](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/human-perception-cognition-action), I developed multimodal object perception skills for **robots** in collaboration with the [IIT in Genoa](https://iit.it) and [Fraunhofer IPA](https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de). 
Later, I joined the interactive video startup [Wirewax](https://wirewax.app) in London where I had the pleasure to work on many fun **computer vision** problems including Face Identification, 
Nudity Detection :eyes: and Object Tracking.

In 2018, I moved to Seoul for a position at [Korea University](https://cogsyslab.notion.site/). My work mostly revolved around decoding, encoding, recoding, and analysing large amounts of **facial data**. 
At that time, I also started with the analysis of **retinal images**. This project eventually turned into [eye2you GmbH](https://eye2you.github.io/), a medtech startup that was set out to create a smart and portable fundus camera for a wide range of medical applications. 

I have a particular interest in **few-shot** settings and **semi-supervised** approaches using unsupervised **generative methods**.

Finally, I'm also a running enthusiast (=addict). Whenever I can, I'll be somewhere on a track or on a trail.
