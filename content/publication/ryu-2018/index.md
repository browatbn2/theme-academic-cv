abstract: 'Purpose : The aim of this study is to develop a novel deep learning system
  for vessel segmentation of retinal images. We present a recurrent Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) architecture and compare performance with existing CNN approaches,
  showing greatly reduced processing time with excellent performance. Methods : The
  proposed DirectNet architecture is composed of blocks, with each block containing
  a collection of convolutional layers. Blocks are stacked up in a pyramid, such that
  the number of blocks is increased by one at each level. Data are repeatedly processed
  by each block and combined with outputs of other blocks. This recurrent structure
  combined with the use of large kernel avoids the need for up-or downsampling layers,
  thus creating a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping from pixel inputs to the outputs of
  segmentation. Results : DirectNet provides higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
  and precision values compared to a state-of-the-art, patch-based CNN approach (0.9538
  vs 0.9327, 0.7851 vs 0.7346, 0.9782 vs 0.9730, 0.8458 vs 0.7987). Training time
  on a standard dataset for DirectNet is reduced from 8 hours to 1 hour, and testing
  time per image is greatly reduced from 1 hour for the patch-based method to 6 seconds
  for our method. Conclusion : The proposed deep-learning architecture is eight times
  faster for training and 600 times faster for testing at slightly higher accuracy
  values than a state-of-the-art method. Segmentation successfully highlights retinal
  blood vessels of large down to small sizes.'
