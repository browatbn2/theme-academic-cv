 abstract = {With increasingly large image databases, searching in them becomes an ever more difficult endeavor. Consequently, there is a need for advanced tools for image retrieval in a webscale context. Searching by tags becomes intractable in such scenarios as large numbers of images will correspond to queries such as "car and house and street". We present a novel approach that allows a user to search for images based on semantic sketches that describe the desired composition of the image. Our system operates on images with labels for a few high-level object categories, allowing us to search very fast with a minimal memory footprint. We employ a structure similar to random decision forests which avails a data-driven partitioning of the image space providing a search in logarithmic time with respect to the number of images. This makes our system applicable for large scale image search problems. We performed a user study that demonstrates the validity and usability of our approach. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},
