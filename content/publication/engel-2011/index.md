abstract: With increasingly large image databases, searching in them becomes an ever
  more difficult endeavor. Consequently, there is a need for advanced tools for image
  retrieval in a webscale context. Searching by tags becomes intractable in such scenarios
  as large numbers of images will correspond to queries such as \"car and house and
  street\". We present a novel approach that allows a user to search for images based
  on semantic sketches that describe the desired composition of the image. Our system
  operates on images with labels for a few high-level object categories, allowing
  us to search very fast with a minimal memory footprint. We employ a structure similar
  to random decision forests which avails a data-driven partitioning of the image
  space providing a search in logarithmic time with respect to the number of images.
  This makes our system applicable for large scale image search problems. We performed
  a user study that demonstrates the validity and usability of our approach. © 2011
