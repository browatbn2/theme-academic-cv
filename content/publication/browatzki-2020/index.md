abstract: We propose an encoder-decoder framework for the segmentation of blood vessels
  in retinal images that relies on the extraction of large-scale patches at multiple
  image-scales during training. Experiments on three fundus image datasets demonstrate
  that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results and can be implemented using
  a simple and efficient fully-convolutional network with a parameter count of less
  than 0.8M. Furthermore, we show that this framework - called VLight - avoids overfitting
  to specific training images and generalizes well across different datasets, which
  makes it highly suitable for real-world applications where robustness, accuracy
  as well as low inference time on high-resolution fundus images is required.
