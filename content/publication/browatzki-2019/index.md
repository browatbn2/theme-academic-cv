abstract: "Current solutions to discriminative and generative tasks in computer vision
  exist separately and often lack interpretability and explainability. Using faces
  as our application domain, here we present an architecture that is based around
  two core ideas that address these issues: first, our framework learns an unsupervised,
  low-dimensional embedding of faces using an adversarial autoencoder that is able
  to synthesize high-quality face images. Second, a supervised disentanglement splits
  the low-dimensional embedding vector into four sub-vectors, each of which contains
  separated information about one of four major face attributes (pose, identity, expression,
  and style) that can be used both for discriminative tasks and for manipulating all
  four attributes in an explicit manner. The resulting architecture achieves state-of-the-art
  image quality, good discrimination and face retrieval results on each of the four
  attributes, and supports various face editing tasks using a face representation
  of only 99 dimensions. Finally, we apply the architecture's robust image synthesis
  capabilities to visually debug label-quality issues in an existing face dataset."
