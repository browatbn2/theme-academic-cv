 abstract = {Categorization of objects solely based on shape and appearance is still a largely unresolved issue. With the advent of new sensor technologies*such as consumer-level range sensors*new possibilities for shape processing have become available for a range of new application domains. In the first part of this paper*we introduce a novel*large dataset containing 18 categories of objects found in typical household and office environmentswe envision this dataset to be useful in many applications ranging from robotics to computer vision. The second part of the paper presents computational experiments on object categorization with classifiers exploiting both two-dimensional and three-dimensional information. We evaluate categorization performance for both modalities in separate and combined representations and demonstrate the advantages of using range data for object and shape processing skills. © 2011 IEEE.},
