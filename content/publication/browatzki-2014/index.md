abstract: Video-based gaze-tracking systems are typically restricted in terms of their
  effective tracking space. This constraint limits the use of eyetrackers in studying
  mobile human behavior. Here, we compare two possible approaches for estimating the
  gaze of participants who are free to walk in a large space whilst looking at different
  regions of a large display. Geometrically, we linearly combined eye-in-head rotations
  and head-in-world coordinates to derive a gaze vector and its intersection with
  a planar display, by relying on the use of a head-mounted eyetrackerand body-motion
  tracker. Alternatively, we employed Gaussian process regression to estimate the
  gaze intersection directly from the input data itself. Our evaluation of both methods
  indicates that a regression approach can deliver comparable results to a geometric
  approach. The regression approach is favored, given that it has the potential for
  further optimization, provides confidence bounds for its gaze estimates and offers
  greater flexibility in its implementation. Open-source software for the methods
  reported here is also provided for user implementation.
